This data is the experimental data of 3-point bending of concrete.
Depth represents the normalized information of the size of the concrete;
alpha indicates the size information of the gap under the concrete;
peakStress is how much force is added to break the concrete;
displacement represents the deflection of the concrete center at fracture.
The characteristic of this data is that there are only a few groups of samples, but due to measurement errors and individual differences in samples, the data is very scattered.
The goal is to establish the relationship between concrete size, notch size, deflection and PeakStress.
